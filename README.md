# The Mirage Source v3.0.3
This repository contains the original Visual Basic 6 open source code for Mirage Online. The source code here is provided as is and lives here for reference only.

### Working from source
Mirage Online was written in Visual basic 6, which means in order to build, debug and release the code you will need to get hold of Visual Studio 6, which is an old and very dated microsoft IDE build specifically for VB6 developers.

Fortunately someone build a tool specifically for installing VS6 on Windows 10 with minimal effort, it does however require you have your own copy of Visual Studio 6 and unfortunately we can't distribute that... but if you have managed to get hold of a copy and want to relive the glory days you can get a free companion installer that will take all the pain from getting it running on Windows 10 on this rather dodgey looking website here:

### Distributing your game to players
As this is a Visual Basic 6 project, in order for players to be able to run the client on modern windows machines they will need to have the VB6 runtime libs installed. Fortunately, a developer by the name of Aydan has put together a small one-click installer that makes this a non-issue -  you can find it in the tools folder.
