# Add bug report

Since nothing is perfect, why not let the players let YOU know what Ã­s wrong with what and so on and so forth.

Lets begin with the Client, you will obviously need some code there.

Open up ```modGameLogic``` and locate

```vba
' Kicking a player 
```

Right under that piece of code for kicking a player, add the following piece of code.

```vba
' Report a bug
If LCase(Mid(MyText, 1, 4)) = "/bug" Then
If Len(MyText) &gt; 5 Then
MyText = Mid(MyText, 6, Len(MyText) - 5)
Call SendBReport(MyText)
End If
MyText = ""
Exit Sub
End If   
```

And now, we open modClientTCP and scroll all way down and add the following code:

```vba
' bugreport
Sub SendBReport(ByVal Text As String)
Dim Packet As String

Packet = "BUGREPORT" &amp; SEP_CHAR &amp; Text &amp; SEP_CHAR &amp; END_CHAR
Call SendData(Packet)
End Sub   
```

Alright, that should do it, save, compile and exit. Now, open the Server project and open ```modDatabase```, right under ```PLAYER_LOG```, add

```vba
Public Const BUG_REPORTS = "bugreports.txt"   
```

Note that you MAY have to change the string for that constant ;P

Anyhow, lets move on and open ```modServerTCP``` and find Location Packet. Just under that piece of code there, add the following:

```vba
' ::::::::::::::::::::::::
' ::  Bugreport packet  ::
' ::::::::::::::::::::::::
If LCase(Parse(0)) = "bugreport" Then

Call PlayerMsg(Index, "Thank you for reporting the bug.", Yellow)
Call AddLog(GetPlayerName(Index) &amp; " reported: " &amp; Parse(1), "bugreports.txt")

Exit Sub
End If
```
